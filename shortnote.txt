Task 6 â€“ Host and Deploy a Web Application on AWS

In this task, I deployed my portfolio website (HTML, CSS, JS) on AWS using S3 and CloudFront.
I created an S3 bucket, uploaded my website files, and blocked public access for security.
Then, I created a CloudFront distribution to serve the site securely and accessed it using the CloudFront URL.

Outcome: Learned how to host a static website on AWS with CloudFront for secure, fast, and global content delivery.
